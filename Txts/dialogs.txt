$THE NEXUS.$ The fake smell hits me right away... A digital lie fed directly to my nervous system.
I swore I would never come back, but the truth is I know this place like the back of my hand.
I can use $w$, $a$, $s$, $d$ and the $arrows$ to move around and attack, or $click$ on my destination.
I need to find the $ACCESS POINT$ and crack its security to advance to my next destination.
OK, it’s hacking time glitches.

$NANO BARRIERS.$ Designed to keep unwanted browsers away.
Too bad. I’m destroying anything that stands in my way.

color:red
The $Access Point$!
It's currently $red$, meaning it's impenetrable.
I need to find an $Open Node$ to connect to the network and hack its defenses.

color:green
I’m jacked in! I should be able to crack the $Access Point$ now.

There’s $Nano Barriers$ everywhere. I’ve never seen that many. That’s not like them.
Why are they all different?
2
color:green
Ugh, where’s that damn $node$?

Shit. I’ve activated the $Defense Operations Onslaught Mechanism Wall$.
A highly advanced security system designed by the machines.
If I stay still it won’t advance and try to fry my brain.
2
color:orange
At the $orange$ level, the D.O.O.M. Wall advances $0.5$ space if I take $1$ turn.
A turn is spent when I move $1$ space or take $1$ action.

How am I gonna... That’s impossible.
There’s way too many nano Barriers for me to reach the Access Point in time.
2
color:light blue
A $Malware Chip$! This will freeze the D.O.O.M. Wall for a duration of 3 turns.

An old human $program$, that will surely come in handy.
I can use them to enhance my deck with new abilities. 
These $Cyber Reality Goggles$ will be equipped automatically once I get back to the terminal.

color:green
If I’m in a tight spot, I can use the $CR Goggles$ to $push back the D.O.O.M. Wall 5 spaces$.
But using any of my $programs$ is gonna cost me $1 Energy$.
And I’m currently all out of $Energy$. 
Dammit.
2
color:pink
Here we go, just what I needed. A $Battery$.
They refill my deck with $1 Energy$.
I can now use my $CR Goggles$ to scan the Wall for weaknesses and push it back.

color:red
Walking through the $red lasers$ will raise the D.O.O.M. Wall to the $red$ level.
At the $red$ level, this bad boy advances $1$ space if I take $1$ turn.
Better be careful.

OK this it, last step before I can unlock The Human Diagnostic Mainframe.
That means the Access Point in here will be protected by a $Mother Intel System$.
These call for an additional layer of hacking, that requires me to $destroy a specific number of each Nano Barriers$.
The $required code$ always appears at the bottom of the screen in my deck. I must match these numbers exactly! 
Oh, and one last thing.
This only applies to Barriers I crack myself.

This Access Point is $locked$... There’s no open node for me to jack in.
These robots aren’t as dumb as they look.
I’m gonna need the $Key Code$ if I wanna crack it.

color:green
Great, more barriers. 
And I don’t see the $open node$ next to the Access Point...
Maybe I can look for a weird pattern?
2
color:blue
Woah, a $Cyber Blade$!
Groovy.

color:blue
If I’m in a rush, I can use the $Circle Whip$ to shatter $everything in the spaces around me$ in one swift move.
Very useful when I’m up against the wall.

color:yellow
What do we have here...
I should try to delay the $D.O.O.M. Wall$? the best I can.
2
color:white
A $Silicon Armor$. Sweet.
This program runs on its own and doesn’t require $Energy$.
It will protect me from taking $1 hit$ and it recharges $every 5 turns$.

color:red
Another Access Point protected by $Mother Intel$. I got this.
Let’s get cracking.

Darn it. These $Plasma lasers$ will cut through my armor like butter.
2
color:blue
I can use this $Quantum Grapple$ to $leap over gaps$ in the Nexus.
It can reach as far as $5 spaces$.
I can hook it to any walls or blocks, and it can also $pull Movable Barriers$ towards me.
Cool stuff.

Woah... $Neutrino Boots$. I’ve heard of those.
I can use them to swap positions with another space in the Nexus code.
If that space is empty I’ll be teleported. If it contains any data, I’ll trade place with it.
I can do that with any space that’s 2 spaces away from me

Yikes. Is that what they think we look like?
It’s gonna take more than foot soldiers following a $pre-programmed route$ to stop me.
Piece of cake.

Uh Oh. These fellas look dangerous.
They seem to be programmed to $seek and destroy$.
Tough luck robots.
I'm not going down without a fight.
