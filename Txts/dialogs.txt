Welcome to the party Pal! This Nexus thing can be pretty rough.
Just remember to take your time, don’t rush it. 
Analyse your surroundings, optimize your actions look at your $programs$.
Delay triggering the wall as much as possible, after that $each of your actions counts!$
Checkout the $Logs$ if you forgot something.

$Neural Amplifiers$. It attaches to the brain to boost the bioelectrical signals that form in the nervous system.
Dirty machine tech, I hate it.
But I also need it, don’t have a choice. I’m just gonna place this here at the back of my hea—
$OUCH!$ What the hell that hurts.
What a horrible sensation... I can feel it, sinking its dirty claws into my head.
But I do feel stronger. Smarter. Quicker. 
I’ll now start every level with $2 Energy Charges$. 
RW3
color:pink
Might as well at this point.
$Yuck$ that really stings.
More $Energy$ for me baby.
RW4
color:pink
Here we go. Still unpleasant but oddly familiar.
What a rush...
I can feel the surge of $Energy$ flowing through my brain.

Just what I needed!
$Ahhhhh. YES.$

log:The virtual world is called $The Nexus$. Movement controls are $WASD$ or the $arrows$. You can also use the mouse and $click$ around. Find the $access point$ and break it.
color:red
$The Nexus$. The fake smell hits me right away... Digital lies fed directly to my nervous system.
I swore I would never come back, but the truth is I know this place like the back of my hand.
I can use $w$, $a$, $s$, $d$ or the $arrows$ to move around and attack, or $click$ on the 4 arrows surrounding me.
I need to find the $ACCESS POINT$ and crack its security to advance to my next destination.
It’s hacking time, glitches!

log:$Byte Barriers$ are blocks put in the way to slow you down.
color:red
$Byte Barriers.$ Designed to keep unwanted browsers away.
Too bad. I’m destroying anything that stands in my way.
3
log:Find an $Open Node$ to make the $Access point vulnerable$.
color:red
The $Access Point$!
It's currently $red$, meaning it's impenetrable.
I need to find an $Open Node$ to connect to the network and hack its defenses.

color:green
I’m jacked in! I should be able to crack the $Access Point$ now.

log:$Byte Barriers$ can have different color and be harder to break.
color:red
There’s $Byte Barriers$ everywhere. I’ve never seen that many. That’s not like them.
Why are they all different?

color:green
Ugh, where’s that damn $node$?

log:The $Defense Operations Onslaught Mechanism Wall$... The $D.O.O.M. Wall$ will kill you if it reaches you. In $the Nexus$, time is turn based.
color:red
Shoot. I’ve activated the $Defense Operations Onslaught Mechanism Wall$.
A highly advanced security system designed by the machines.
If I stay still it won’t advance and try to fry my brain.
2
log:The $D.O.O.M. Wall$ will be activated if you walk into an orange laser tile. It advances 0.5 space when you take 1 turn. A turn is spend when you move $1$ space or take $1$ action.
color:orange
At the $orange$ level, the D.O.O.M. Wall advances $0.5$ space if I take $1$ turn.
A turn is spent when I move $1$ space or take $1$ action.

How am I gonna... That’s impossible.
There’s way too many Byte Barriers for me to reach the Access Point in time.

log:$Malware Chips$ will freeze the D.O.O.M. Wall for a duration of 3 turns.
color:light blue
A $Malware Chip$! This will freeze the D.O.O.M. Wall for a duration of 3 turns.

log:$Programs$ can be found in the Nexus to give you new abilities. They are installed after you reach the access Point.
color:green
An old human $program$, that will surely come in handy.
I can use those to enhance my deck with new abilities. 
These $Cyber Reality Goggles$ will be equipped automatically once I get back to the terminal.
2
log:$CR Goggles$ can push back the the D.O.O.M. Wall 5 spaces. But using any of my $programs$ is gonna cost me $1 Energy Charge$.
color:green
If I’m in a tight spot, I can use the $CR Goggles$ to $push back the D.O.O.M. Wall 5 spaces$.
But using any of my $programs$ is gonna cost me $1 Energy Charge$.
My available $Energy Charges$ are displayed at the bottom of my deck on the $Brain Icon$.
And I’m currently all out of $Energy$. 
Dammit.

2
log:$Batteries$ give you $1 Energy Charge$ to use on programs.
color:pink
Here we go, just what I needed. A $Battery$.
They refill my deck with $1 Energy Charge$.
I can now use my $CR Goggles$ to scan the Wall for weaknesses and push it back.

log:Walking through the $red lasers$ will raise the D.O.O.M. Wall to the $red$ level. At the $red$ level, this bad boy advances $1$ space if you take $1$ turn.

Better be careful.

OK that’s a lot of Barriers.
Kind of rude.
I don’t think I can destroy all of those on my own...

log:To hack the terminal, the final step is to find the Acces Point protected by a $Mother Intel System$. These call for an additional layer of hacking, that requires you to $destroy a specific number of each Byte Barriers$. The $required code$ always appears at the bottom of the screen in your deck. You must match these numbers exactly! This only applies to barriers you crack yourself.
color:blue
OK this it, last step before I can unlock Sentient Assembly Plant.
That means the Access Point in here will be protected by a $Mother Intel System$.

The $required code$ always appears at the bottom of the screen in my deck. I must match these numbers exactly! 
Oh, and one last thing, this only applies to Barriers I crack myself.
If I need to let the D.O.O.M. Wall do its thing, I can use the $SPACE BAR$ to skip turns.

log:A $Key Code$ is an other way to crack an Acces Point.
color: red
This Access Point is $locked$... There’s no open node for me to jack in.
These robots aren’t as dumb as they look.
I’m gonna need the $Key Code$ if I wanna crack it.

log:Sometime, a Byte Barrier can hide the $open node$.
color:green
Great, more Barriers. 
And I don’t see the $open node$ next to the Access Point...
Maybe I can look for a weird pattern?

Woah, a $Neo Blade$!
Groovy.

log:Use the $Neo Blade$ to shatter $everything in the spaces around you$ in one swift move.

If I’m in a rush, I can use the $Neo Blade$ to shatter $everything in the spaces around me$ in one swift move.
Very useful when I’m up against the wall.

What do we have here...
I should try to delay the $D.O.O.M. Wall$? the best I can.

A $Silicone Armor$. Sweet.

It will protect me from taking $1 hit$ and it recharges $every 4 turns$.

Alright, last level before I get that door open. Just gotta get through that $Mother Intel$.
There’s a lot going on here...
But I got this. Time to get creative, let’s get cracking!

Darn it. These $Plasma lasers$ will cut through my armor like butter.

log:I can use the $Neutrino Boots$ to swap positions with another space in the Nexus code. If that space is empty you’ll be teleported. If it contains any data, you’ll trade place with it. You can do that with any block that’s 2 spaces away from you.
color:purple
Woah... $Neutrino Boots$. I’ve heard of those.
I can use them to swap positions with another space in the Nexus code.
If that space is empty I’ll be teleported. If it contains any data, I’ll trade place with it.

Yikes. Is that what they think we look like?
It’s gonna take more than foot soldiers following a $pre-programmed route$ to stop me.
Piece of cake.

Uh Oh. These fellas look dangerous.
They seem to be programmed to $seek and destroy$.
Tough luck, machines.
I'm not going down without a fight.
