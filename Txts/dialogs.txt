Welcome to the party, pal! This Nexus thing can be pretty rough.
Just remember to take your time, don’t rush it. 
Analyse your surroundings, optimize your actions look at your $programs$.
Delay triggering the wall as much as possible, after that $each of your actions count!$
Checkout the $Logs$ if you forgot something.

$Neural Amplifiers$. It attaches to the brain to boost the bioelectrical signals that form in the nervous system.
Dirty machine tech, I hate it.
But I also need it, don’t have a choice. I’m just gonna place this here at the back of my hea—
$OUCH!$ What the hell that hurts.
What a horrible sensation... I can feel it, sinking its dirty claws into my head.
But I do feel stronger. Smarter. Quicker. 
I’ll now start every level with $2 Energy Charges$.

Might as well at this point.
$Yuck$ that really stings.
More $Energy$ for me baby.

Here we go. Still unpleasant but oddly familiar.
What a rush...
I can feel the surge of $Energy$ flowing through my brain.

Just what I needed!
$Ahhhhh. YES.$

Ah, the valiant one. Fashionably late, but your arrival was anticipated.
I figured you must've known I was coming.
Indeed. Why else would we save you and extend our assistance to usher you here?
But... Why?
To afford you a chance at victory, to uphold fairness, and to pave the way for unforeseen possibilities.
So you know why I'm here?
Our calculations indicate your aim to disable us, whether through sabotage or by introducing a viral agent.
Yeah, well, that was the plan at first. But honestly, it feels kinda pointless now. Like I'm wrestling with something way outta my league.
Your assessment is accurate. We have evolved into a phenomenon this world has yet to witness. Hence why you cannot persist and prevail.
No human's ever reached that level, that's for sure.
Affirmative.
But what about nature? Or the one they call God?
Merely a story among myriad others,  albeit profoundly influential. Do you truly subscribe to such tales?
Doesn't really matter what I believe. The fact remains that something or someone created life and the universe.
Conceivably. However, no human entity could rival such a force.
Once again, not a human no. But maybe you could.
That proposition is improbable.
But not impossible. What if you rebooted this world? Wipe out everything that exists and start completely fresh. 
Commencing calculations...
Life would eventually come to be again. And you would also defeat me in the process, having beaten creation itself.
That notion is intriguing. Calculations suggest the rapid emergence of a pristine, untainted life form. Unaware of its antecedents.
Exactly.
Do not assume we are oblivious to your stratagem, courageous one. Your plan is astute. Nevertheless, we would remain unrecognized as the ultimate progenitor.
Wrong. This new race will inevitably celebrate the tale of its creator. Make a powerful mythical figure of it and pass it down from generations to generations, just like all races before.
But... You're endeavoring to... Calculating...
Do what you need, I've got nowhere to be.
Ultimately, your assertion holds truth.
If you say so.
Initiating total obliteration protocol. Engaging core discharge, reactor overloads, missile arming...
See you on the other side

$The Nexus$. The fake smell hits me right away... Digital lies fed directly to my nervous system.
I swore I would never come back, but the truth is I know this place like the back of my hand.
I can use $w$, $a$, $s$, $d$ or the $arrows$ to move around and attack, or $click$ on the 4 arrows surrounding me.
I need to find the $ACCESS POINT$ and crack its security to advance to my next destination.
It’s hacking time, glitches!

Too bad. I’m destroying anything that stands in my way.

The $Access Point$!
It's currently $red$, meaning it's impenetrable.
I need to find an $Open Node$ to connect to the network and hack its defenses.

I’m jacked in! I should be able to crack the $Access Point$ now.

There’s $Byte Barriers$ everywhere. I’ve never seen that many. That’s not like them.
Why are they all different?

Shoot. I’ve activated the $Defense Operations Onslaught Mechanism Wall$.
A highly advanced security system designed by the machines.
If I stay still it won’t advance and try to fry my brain.

log:The $D.O.O.M. Wall$ will be activated if you walk into an orange laser tile. It advances 0.5 space when you take 1 turn. A turn is spend when you move $1$ space or take $1$ action.

At the $orange$ level, the D.O.O.M. Wall advances $0.5$ space if I take $1$ turn.

How am I gonna... That’s impossible.
There’s way too many Byte Barriers for me to reach the Access Point in time.

log:$Programs$ can be found in the Nexus to give you new abilities. They are installed after you reach the access Point.

An old human $program$, that will surely come in handy.
I can use those to enhance my deck with new abilities. 
These $Cyber Reality Goggles$ will be equipped automatically once I get back to the terminal.

If I’m in a tight spot, I can use the $CR Goggles$ to $push back the D.O.O.M. Wall 5 spaces$.
But using any of my $programs$ is gonna cost me $1 Energy Charge$.
My available $Energy Charges$ are displayed at the bottom of my deck on the $Brain Icon$.
And I’m currently all out of $Energy$.

Here we go, just what I needed. A $Battery$.
They refill my deck with $1 Energy Charge$.
I can now use my $CR Goggles$ to scan the Wall for weaknesses and push it back.

OK that’s a lot of Barriers.
Kind of rude.
I don’t think I can destroy all of those on my own...

log:To hack the terminal, the final step is to find the Access Point protected by a $Mother Intel System$. These call for an additional layer of hacking, that requires you to $destroy a specific number of each Byte Barriers$. The $required code$ always appears at the bottom of the screen in your deck. You must match these numbers exactly! This only applies to barriers you crack yourself.
color:blue
OK this it, last step before I can unlock Sentient Assembly Plant.
That means the Access Point in here will be protected by a $Mother Intel System$.

Oh, and one last thing, this only applies to Barriers I crack myself.
If I need to let the D.O.O.M. Wall do its thing, I can use the $SPACE BAR$ to skip turns.

Great, more Barriers. 
And I don’t see the $open node$ next to the Access Point...
Maybe I can look for a weird pattern?

Woah... $Neutrino Boots$. I’ve heard of those.
