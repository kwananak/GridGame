$THE NEXUS.$ The fake smell hits me right away... A digital lie fed directly to my nervous system.
I swore I would never come back, but the truth is I know this place like the back of my hand.
I can use $w$, $a$, $s$, $d$ and the $arrows$ to move around and attack, or $click$ on my destination.
I need to find the $ACCESS POINT$ and crack its security to advance to my next destination.
OK, it’s hacking time glitches.

$NANO BARRIERS.$ Designed to keep unwanted browsers away.
Too bad. I’m destroying anything that stands in my way.

The $Access Point$!
It's currently $red$, meaning it's impenetrable.
I need to find an $Open Node$ to connect to the network and hack its defenses.

I’m jacked in! I should be able to crack the $Access Point$ now.

There’s $Nano Barriers$ everywhere. I’ve never seen that many. That’s not like them.
Why are they all different?

Ugh, where’s that damn $node$?

Shit. I’ve activated the $Defense Operations Onslaught Mechanism Wall$.
A highly advanced security system designed by the machines.
If I stay still it won’t advance and try to fry my brain.

At the $orange$ level, the D.O.O.M. Wall advances $0.5$ space if I take $1$ turn.
A turn is spent when I move $1$ space or take $1$ action.

How am I gonna... That’s impossible.
There’s way too many nano Barriers for me to reach the Access Point in time.

A $Malware Chip$! This will freeze the D.O.O.M. Wall for a duration of 3 turns.

An old human $program$, that will surely come in handy.
I can use them to enhance my deck with new abilities. 
These $Cyber Reality Goggles$ will be equipped automatically once I get back to the terminal.

If I’m in a tight spot, I can use the $CR Goggles$ to $push back the D.O.O.M. Wall 5 spaces$.
But using any of my $programs$ is gonna cost me $1 Energy$.
And I’m currently all out of $Energy$. 
Dammit.

color:pink
Here we go, just what I needed. A $Battery$.
They refill my deck with $1 Energy$.
I can now use my $CR Goggles$ to scan the Wall for weaknesses and push it back.

Walking through the $red lasers$ will raise the D.O.O.M. Wall to the $red$ level.
At the $red$ level, this bad boy advances $1$ space if I take $1$ turn.
Better be careful.

OK this it, last step before I can unlock The Human Diagnostic Mainframe.
That means the Access Point in here will be protected by a $Mother Intel System$.
These call for an additional layer of hacking, that requires me to $destroy a specific number of each Nano Barriers$.
The $required code$ always appears at the bottom of the screen in my deck. I must match these numbers exactly! 
Oh, and one last thing.
This only applies to Barriers I crack myself.
