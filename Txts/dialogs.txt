log:The virtual world is called $The Nexus$. Movement control : $w$, $a$, $s$, $d$ or $arrow$. You can also use the mouse and $click$ around. Find the $access point$ and break it.
color:red
$The Nexus$. The fake smell hits me right away... A digital lie fed directly to my nervous system.
I swore I would never come back, but the truth is I know this place like the back of my hand.
I can use $w$, $a$, $s$, $d$ or the $arrows$ to move around and attack, or $click$ on my destination.
I need to find the $ACCESS POINT$ and crack its security to advance to my next destination.
It’s hacking time, glitches!

log:$Nano Barrier$ are block put in the way to slow you down.
color:red
$Nano Barriers.$ Designed to keep unwanted browsers away.
Too bad. I’m destroying anything that stands in my way.

log:Find an $Open Node$ to make the $Access point vulnarable$.
color:red
The $Access Point$!
It's currently $red$, meaning it's impenetrable.
I need to find an $Open Node$ to connect to the network and hack its defenses.

color:green
I’m jacked in! I should be able to crack the $Access Point$ now.

log:$Nano Barriers$ can have different color and complexity to break them.
color:red
There’s $Nano Barriers$ everywhere. I’ve never seen that many. That’s not like them.
Why are they all different?

Ugh, where’s that damn $node$?

log:The $Defense Operations Onslaught Mechanism Wall$ also call $D.O.O.M. Wall$ will kill you if it reach you. In $the Nexus$, time is turn base.
color:red
Shoot. I’ve activated the $Defense Operations Onslaught Mechanism Wall$.
A highly advanced security system designed by the machines.
If I stay still it won’t advance and try to fry my brain.
2
log:The $D.O.O.M. Wall$ will be activated if you walk into an orange laser tile. It's advance 0.5 space when I take 1 turn. A turn is spend when I move $1$ space or take $1$ action.
color:orange
At the $orange$ level, the D.O.O.M. Wall advances $0.5$ space if I take $1$ turn.
A turn is spent when I move $1$ space or take $1$ action.

How am I gonna... That’s impossible.
There’s way too many nano Barriers for me to reach the Access Point in time.

log:$Programs$ can be find in the Nexus to give you new abilities. They are install after you reach the access Point.
color:green
An old human $program$, that will surely come in handy.
I can use them to enhance my deck with new abilities. 
These $Cyber Reality Goggles$ will be equipped automatically once I get back to the terminal.

log:$Cr Goggles$ can push back the the D.O.O.M. Wall 5 spaces. It cost $1 Energy$ to activate them.
color:green
If I’m in a tight spot, I can use the $CR Goggles$ to $push back the D.O.O.M. Wall 5 spaces$.
But using any of my $programs$ is gonna cost me $1 Energy$.
And I’m currently all out of $Energy$. 
Dammit.
2
log:$Battery$ give you $1 Energy$ to use on programs.
color:pink
Here we go, just what I needed. A $Battery$.
They refill my deck with $1 Energy$.
I can now use my $CR Goggles$ to scan the Wall for weaknesses and push it back.

At the $red$ level, this bad boy advances $1$ space if I take $1$ turn.

Better be careful.

log:To hack the terminal, the final step is to find the Acces Point protected by a $Mother Intel System$. These call for an additional layer of hacking, that requires me to $destroy a specific number of each Nano Barriers$. The $required code$ always appears at the bottom of the screen in my deck. I must match these numbers exactly! This only applies to Barriers I crack myself.
color:red
OK this it, last step before I can unlock The Human Diagnostic Mainframe.
That means the Access Point in here will be protected by a $Mother Intel System$.

Oh, and one last thing.
This only applies to Barriers I crack myself.

log:$Key Code$ is an other way to crack an Acces Point.
color: red
This Access Point is $locked$... There’s no open node for me to jack in.
These robots aren’t as dumb as they look.
I’m gonna need the $Key Code$ if I wanna crack it.

log:Sometime a Nano Barrier can hide the $open node$.
color:green
Great, more barriers. 
And I don’t see the $open node$ next to the Access Point...
Maybe I can look for a weird pattern?

Woah, a $Circle Whip$!
Groovy.

What do we have here...
I should try to delay the $D.O.O.M. Wall$? the best I can.

log:I can use the $Neutrino Boots$ to swap positions with another space in the Nexus code.
If that space is empty I’ll be teleported. If it contains any data, I’ll trade place with it.
I can do that with any space that’s 2 spaces away from me

Woah... $Neutrino Boots$. I’ve heard of those.
I can use them to swap positions with another space in the Nexus code.

Yikes. Is that what they think we look like?
It’s gonna take more than foot soldiers following a $pre-programmed route$ to stop me.
Piece of cake.

Tough luck robots.
I'm not going down without a fight.
